As of version 1.2.0, `joineR` fits the joint model proposed by Williamson et al.
(2008) for joint models of longitudinal data and competing risks. Here, the 
longitudinal data submodel remains as per that analyzed in Henderson et al. 
(2000), namely

$$Y_i(t) = X_i(t)^\top \beta + Z_i(t)^\top U_i + \epsilon_i(t),$$

where $Y_i(t)$ is a repeated measurement on subject $i$ at time $t$, $U_i$ is a 
latent vector that follows a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution, 
$X_i(t)$ and $Z_i(t)$ are vectors of explanatory variables that may be 
time-constant or time-varying, and the $\epsilon_i(t)$ are mutually independent
errors, $\epsilon_i(t) \sim {\rm N}(0, \tau^2)$.

For the competing risks data, a cause-specific hazards submodel is proposed, 
namely

$$\lambda_{ig}(t) = \lambda_{0g}(t) \exp(W_i^\top \alpha_g + \gamma_g V_{ig}),$$

where $W_i$ is a vectors of time-constant explanatory variables, $V_i$ is 
another latent vector that follows a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution,
and $\lambda_{0g}(t)$ is the baseline hazard function for cause $g = 1, 2$. In
`joineR`, when competing risks data are analysed, $Z_i(t)^\top  = (1, t)$, We
also note that currently only 2 failure types are be modelled, which must be
coded as 1 and 2 (with 0 representing censoring).

# Example

We will perform the analysis from Williamson et al. (2008) to the SANAD
(Standard And New Antiepileptic Drugs) study data -- the largest trial of AEDs
to date (Marson et al., 2007).

## Background

The time to withdrawal of a randomized drug or addition of another, has been 
recommended by the International League Against Epilepsy to be one of the 
primary endpoints for clinical trials of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) (Commission
on Antiepileptic Drugs, 1998). Patients may decide to switch to an alternative 
AED because of inadequate seizure control (ISC) or to withdraw from a treatment 
because of unacceptable adverse effects (UAE). Overall analysis of treatment 
failures may miss differential effects of AEDs on the reasons for withdrawal, 
which may differ in terms of their relative importance for patients (Williamson 
et al., 2007).

The primary SANAD analysis of patients with partial epilepsy concluded that the 
newer drug lamotrigine (LTG) was preferable in terms of treatment failure to 
carbamazepine (CBZ), which had been the standard for many years (Williamson et 
al., 2006). LTG was significantly better in terms of withdrawal for UAE and not 
significantly worse in terms of withdrawal for poor seizure control. Subsequent 
correspondence after the trial results were published indicated that some 
readers were concerned that differential titration rates may have been to the 
disadvantage of CBZ (Cross et al., 2007). An AED that is titrated more quickly 
may bring benefits in terms of seizure control but be more likely to cause 
adverse effects. This criticism has also been leveled at previous AED trials 
(O’Donoghue & Sander, 1995).

## Data

SANAD was an unblinded randomized trial recruiting patients with epilepsy for 
whom CBZ was considered to be standard treatment and they were randomized to 
CBZ, gabapentin, LTG, oxcarbazepine or topiramate (Marson et al., 2007). Time to
treatment failure was a primary outcome with the analysis of competing risks, 
i.e. treatment failure due to either ISC or UAE, an important secondary 
objective. Although LTG appeared to be superior to CBZ in the main analysis, 
concerns were raised that the results were biased in favor of the newer drug. 
CBZ was considered to have been titrated more quickly bringing benefits in terms
of seizure control but being more likely to cause adverse effects. The data set 
analysed here, comparing CBZ and LTG, includes 605 patients. During the trial, 
94 patients withdrew from the randomized drug due to UAE while 120 withdrew due 
to ISC. In order to compare the two AEDs after adjusting for titration rate, 
dose calibration was first undertaken by standardizing the dose of both drugs 
relative to the midpoint of the maintenance dose range for each particular drug.
The maintenance dose recommended in the SANAD trial was independently deemed to 
be reasonable (Faught, 2007) and the approach to calibration considered 
sensible. These calibrated doses are taken to be the longitudinal measurements 
in the competing-risks joint model.

The data is available in the `joineR` package by running

```{r epileptic_data}
library(joineR)
data(epileptic)
head(epileptic)
```

In the analysis, Williamson et al. (2008) considered an interaction term between
time and treatment in the longitudinal data submodel. Therefore, we will 
manually code this term using

```{r interaction_data}
epileptic$interaction <- with(epileptic, time * (treat == "LTG"))
```

A `jointdata` object is first constructed using the `jointdata()` function. Note
that there are several status columns: `with.status` is a composite event status
(treatment failure or censored), `with.status.uae` is a binary event status for 
UAE (with failure due to ISC treated as censoring), `with.status.isc` is a 
binary event status for ISC (with failure due to UAE treated as censoring), and 
`with.status2` is a vector taking values 0, 1, and 2, with 0 denoting censoring 
and 1 and 2 denoting dropout due to ISC and UAE, respectively.

```{r jointdata, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
longitudinal <- epileptic[, c(1:3, 13)]
survival <- UniqueVariables(epileptic, c(4, 6), "id")
baseline <- UniqueVariables(epileptic, "treat", "id")
data <- jointdata(longitudinal = longitudinal, 
                  survival = survival,
                  baseline = baseline,
                  id.col = "id", time.col = "time")

summary(data)
jointplot(data, Y.col = "dose", Cens.col = "with.status2")
```

## Model

To fit the joint model, we use the usual `joint()` function as

```{r jointmodel}
fit2 <- joint(data = data, long.formula = dose ~ time + treat + interaction,
              surv.formula = Surv(with.time, with.status2) ~ treat,
              longsep = FALSE, survsep = FALSE, gpt = 3)

summary(fit2)
```

To estimate standard errors, we use the `jointSE()` function as follows. 
However, we do not run the code in this vignette due to computational time 
required.

```{r jointmodel_ses, eval=FALSE}
fit2.se <- jointSE(fit2, n.boot = 100)
fit2.se
```

## Conclusion

Significant $\gamma$ estimates in the model suggests that calibrated dose is 
associated with time to treatment failure for both particular causes. It is 
observed that these estimates have opposite signs for the two failure reasons. 
This was a situation anticipated previously in this application, since side 
effects are more likely at higher doses, whereas seizure control is poorer at 
low doses (Williamson et al., 2006). Thus, patients on higher doses may be more 
likely to be withdrawn from treatment due to poor seizure control since the 
reason they are on higher doses is that they are having continued seizures. 
Patients on higher doses may also be less likely to be withdrawn from treatment 
due to UAE since the reason a required dose increase is possible is because no 
such events have occurred

The results from all models fitted suggest that if LTG is titrated at the same 
rate as CBZ, the beneficial effect of LTG on UAE would still be evident and the 
two drugs still appear to provide similar seizure control. Thus, the conclusion 
from the original simpler analysis of the cause-specific hazards is found to be 
robust to the variation in titration between the drugs in the trial.
